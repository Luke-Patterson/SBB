# SBB
An experiment in teaching AI to play the card game Storybook Brawl (SBB). SBB's rules and all the object have been fully programmed, and can play games by making random decisions. I am currently playing around with a XGBoost algorithm that can predict win probability based on a current board state, and building forward vision for the computer to anticipate what positions are optimal for a given hand of characters.
